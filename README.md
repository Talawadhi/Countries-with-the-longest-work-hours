Countries with the longest work hours
Which countries have citizens putting in the longest work hours and how have these trends been changing over time?

I will try to answer these questions by analyzing data from OECD Employment and Labour Market Statistics database which provides data on average annual labor hours for most developed countries dating back to 1950.

Data can be accessed here https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/employment/data/hours-worked/average-annual-hours-actually-worked_data-00303-en
